\title{Quantify Means of Subgroup}
\usage{
quantify_means_of_subgroup(subgroup_m, mean_var, df, grouping_var,
  num_display = "PM", show_pval = TRUE, digits = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{subgroup_m}{Subgroup variable of interest (must be factor)}

\item{mean_var}{Numeric variable from which to calculate mean and sd}

\item{df}{Dataset containing covariates}

\item{grouping_var}{Variable to group by (will be columns of table)}

\item{num_display}{How should results be displayed? ('PM' for mean +- sd, 'PRS' for mean (sd))}

\item{show_pval}{Logical.  Should the p-value results be displayed?}

\item{digits}{Number of digits to round decimals}
}
\value{
A data frame summarizing mean and sd of a numeric variable by grouping and specific subgroup
    variable levels
}
\description{
This function allows you to calculate  mean and sd of a numeric variable by grouping
    and specific subgroup variable levels (ie. mean age of those belonging to subgroup 1 or 2 by
    levels of grouping variable)
}
